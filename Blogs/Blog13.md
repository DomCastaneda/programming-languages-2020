The Chomsky Hierarchy in Theory of Computation states that languages are divided into 4 types:

**Type 0 (Unrestricted Grammar)** is a language that can be enumerated by any formal grammar, and this turns out to be equivalent to being recognizable by a Turing machine. These are know as Recusrively Enumerable languages.

**Type 1 (Context Sensitive Grammar)** is a language that is generated by **linear bound automata**. A Type 1 grammar is also considered Type 0. "A linear bounded automaton is a nondeterministic Turing machine that satisfies the following:

1. Its input alphabet includes two special symbols, serving as left and right endmarkers.
2. Its transitions may not print other symbols over the endmarkers.
3. Its transitions may neither move to the left of the left endmarker nor to the right of the right endmarker"(wiki).

**Type 2 (Context Free Grammar)** is a language that is recognized by a Pushdown automata. "A Pushdown automata is a finite automata with extra memory called stack which helps Pushdown automata to recognize Context Free Languages."(geeksforgeeks)

**Type 3 (Regular Grammar)** is a language that can be accepted by a finite state automaton.The finite automata or finite state machine is an abstract machine which have five elements or tuple. It is a very restricted language.
