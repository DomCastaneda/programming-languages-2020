# Week 6 Blog
**The next couple blogs I will go into Turing completeness, Church encoding, and the Church-Turing Thesis.**
## The Turing Machine
In 1935, Alan Turing developed the Turing Machine, a hypothetical, mathematical model created to argue any function with natural numbers can be computed. The machine can simulate any computer algorithm, regardless of complexity. 

The machine is not a real 'machine', but rather a mathematical concept that consists of a system of rules with states and transitions. The Turing Machine has the two purposes of deciding formal languages and solving mathematical functions.
