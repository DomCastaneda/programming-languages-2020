# Week 6 Blog
**The next couple blogs I will go into Turing completeness, Church encoding, and the Church-Turing Thesis.**
## The Turing Machine
In 1935, Alan Turing developed the Turing Machine, a hypothetical, mathematical model created to argue that any function with natural numbers can be computed. It can simulate any computer algorithm, regardless of complexity. The machine is not a real 'machine', but rather a mathematical concept that consists of a system of rules with states and transitions. The Turing Machine has the two purposes of deciding formal languages and solving mathematical functions. Turing's objective for building the model was to form how we do abstract reasoning.

## Turing's Thesis
**Turing's demonstration of his mathematical model showed that everything that can be computed by a human computer using a fixed procedure, can be computed by the Turing Machine. “L.C.M.s [Logical Computing Machines] can do anything that could be described as ‘rule of thumb’ or ‘purely mechanical’.” (Stanford.edu)**
