# Week 14 Blog
**For this short blog I will go over some information I found on Kolmogorov complexity.**
## Kolmogorov Complexity
The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the object as output.

For Example, here is a less complex and more complex string.

**Less Complex: Write ab 5 times.**
```
ababababab
```

**More Complex**
```
2duwhaidxn
```
The complexity of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string. "Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself."(wiki) A string's complexity is not related to string size, but the shortest description of that string. Kolmogorov complexity can be applied to any mathematical model, not just strings.
