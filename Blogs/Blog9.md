## Optional Exercise (Turing machines as rewrite systems)
Any TM can be equivalently formulated as a string rewriting system. A string rewriting system(SRS) is a tuple (Σ,A). Σ is a letter and is assumed finite. a is a binary relation on strings. Each ∈ A has a rewriting rule written like a->b.

Here are 2 examples of simple SRS:
