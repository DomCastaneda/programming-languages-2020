## Church-Turing Thesis
Every model of computation makes the same distinction between computable and non-computable languages, called the Church-Turing thesis. The thesis states that any computation can be translated into an equivalent computation involving a Turing machine. Alzonzo Church argued that any calculaition can be done using his lambda calculus. This is done by using recursive functions. The thesis has never had a proof, but the evidence for its validity has been accepted because every realistic computation has been equivalent to the Turing machine answers.

The Church Turing Thesis concept of an effective method in logic is explained at stanford.edu:

"A method, or procedure, M, for achieving some desired result is called effective just in case:

1. M is set out in terms of a finite number of exact instructions (each instruction being expressed by means of a finite number of symbols);
2. M will, if carried out without error, produce the desired result in a finite number of steps;
3. M can (in practice or in principle) be carried out by a human being unaided by any machinery except paper and pencil;
4. M demands no insight, intuition, or ingenuity, on the part of the human being carrying out the method."

The thesis basically states that a function with natural numbers is an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.
